This is a proof of concept, that Kotlin mods are possible in Minecraft 1.7.10.

Do not use this version for production tho. Use BanHammerJ.

A simple modpack banning tool. 

Just place the UUID file of banned people in your config/Bans folder
or recompile this mod with hardcoded UUIDs in the BanLoader.java

Usage cases:	Serveral Servers running your modpack and you want to ban people over these servers,
				just add the UUID files or the new compiled mod in the next version.
				
WARNING: DO NOT SHIP THIS MOD CLIENTSIDE. IT WILL CORRUPT SSP WORLDS ON BANNED PLAYERS.
